### **Steps**

1. Cloning the application:

```sh

$ git clone https://github.com/viniciusrma/ChallengeBr

```

2. Running the Application:

The application runs in two parts:

## Server-api

```sh

# Open the terminal in the root directory and type:

$ cd server_api

# Then install the dependences by typing:

$ yarn / or npm install

# If you don't have the docker installed in global way, you will have to do this to have access to the DB.

- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ - Here you sill find instructions to install it on your machine.

# Then you have to connect do the DB instance, running the command below:

$ docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# Notice that the database name, the name of the user and the password are all 'postgres'.

# Then you have to start the DB, by running the command below:

$ docker start postgres

# You can also run using docker-compose, there is already a yaml file on the root directory of the server_api, so you can run it with:

$ docker-compose up -d

# But to do that you should first install docker-compose. You can find it here:

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

# Then you can run the development environment by typing:

$ yarn dev

```

## Web

```sh

# Open other terminal in the root directory and type:

$ cd web

# Install the dependences by typing:

$ yarn / or npm install

# Then run:

$ yarn start

```
